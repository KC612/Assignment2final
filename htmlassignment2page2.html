        <P><strong>I <i>mostly</i> got over my fear of heights last year!</strong> I visted a watchtower & walked on the rock edge of Bruce Peninsula National Park, rode the big rides at wonderland, and attempted a 25 feet pencil dive at Wonderland's Mountain Bay Cliffs!</P>

    <h2 style="font-size: large;"><u>My Goals for Web programing and Design</u></h2>
    <p id="p0">Given that my prior practice in html has only been in browser with websites like Progate I am excited to expand my knowledge with this course. I have already learned how to use <span style="background-color: blueviolet; color: plum;">span and color tags</span> as well as <small>small text</small>,<s>strikethrough</s>, <sub>subscript</sub>,<sup>superscript<sup> and <strong>more</strong>.</p>
    <p id="p0">My goal is to apply this knowelge to make interactive websites for personal and professional reasons. In highschool I wanted to make my own personal website using HTML but could never find the time, now I have the ability to do so. I am also learning about completely new things like Git and Github. I plan to apply what I learn both in this course and the rest of my life. I have already learned so much about HTML and CSS over these few weeks.</p>
        <p><q>HTML is Fun!</q></p>
